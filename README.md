This is a slot machine app using Sprocket's photos. The app uses OOP. I centered everything for readability. I kept the design very simple. 
You click the spin button and the three coloumns will randomly generate 50 times. If the three pics are the same you win. For some reason it
also lets you win with certain pairs. I ran out of time to fix this issue. I would also have added in more => functions and cleaned up the code more.
This way was the simplest for me to understand when broken down very small. Please have fun with it!
